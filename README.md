# Emojipedia

This is a simple mini-project which has been created while following the course [Web-Development course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ "Angela Yu's Course Homepage"), which is pretty fantastic btw if you're a beginner in web development, kinda like me.

## What this code does

This is a ReactJS application which displays the list of all the emojis along with their meanings. The emoji list is populated from a JSON file which is displayed on the page. Any changes to the file, would result in changes in the page.

## Technologies used

- React (V16.13.1)
- HTML/CSS

## How to run this code

- Clone the github repo
  > `git clone https://github.com/praaatik/emojipedia`
- Switch to the directory of the project
  > `cd emojipedia`
- Install all the packages from `packages.json`
  > `npm install`
- Run the site by
  > `npm start`

## Addendum

- The react version can be checked by switching into the directory of the project and running
  > `npm view react version`
- The JSON file containing all the emoji meanings has been taken from https://gist.github.com/gencer/8840f66963d06a5efb8523bb779c2d0b
- Might add some functionality to search for the emojis, but any PRs are welcomed :)
